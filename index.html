<p>In this video, I will explain what full stack development is and provide a detailed overview of the technologies used to build full stack web applications. Full stack web development involves building the front-end, back-end, and database components of a web application. This means that full stack developers are responsible for everything from designing the user interface to managing the server-side logic and database.

    I will begin by discussing the key technologies and programming languages used in full stack web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and various front-end frameworks such as React and Angular. </p>

<p>By the end of this video, you will have a comprehensive understanding of what full stack web development is and the tools and technologies used by full stack developers to create powerful web applications.</p>

<h3>Lets Divide Full stack into 3 parts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Frontend</li>
    <li>Backend</li>
    <li>Database</li>
</ul>
